#### Code Linters

- This project use two different code linters and a another extension to the IDE, that is...

##### Eslint

- Or EcmaScriptLint, is the linter responsible to check problems in the syntax and return errors, your configurations are shared and used by others linters

##### Prettier

- This linter is used only for check the code style, they don't will check the syntax, just find a way to do the code more legible and have a integration with eslint

##### Editor Config

- That isn't a linter, just a extension to share some configs between other editors, like the format of the end of lines, identation with spaces or tabs, etc...
